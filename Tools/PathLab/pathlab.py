"""
PathLab - a sandbox for the group-movement work in GameEngine/Source/GameLogic/AI.

The engine's pathfinder is a 10-unit grid, 8-way A*, cost 10 orthogonal / 14 diagonal, with a
congestion map of other units' remaining paths.  Group orders either take one shared corridor split
into lanes (AIGroup::friend_computeGroundPath + friend_moveVehicleToPos) or fall back to one A* per
unit.  All of that is reproduced here at the same numbers, so a change can be looked at - with the
line-of-sight rays every check actually makes drawn on screen - before it is written in C++.

The congestion map has no clock in it, so it cannot tell a shared road from a crossing.  On top of
it there is a reservation map - *when* each unit expects to be in each cell - and a second cost paid
only when two units want the same cell at the same moment.  That is the expensive case: a road two
columns use one after the other is fine, a junction they reach together is not.

    python pathlab.py                 # corridor mode, the engine's default
    python pathlab.py --mode single   # -nogrouppath: one path per unit, congestion the whole way
    python pathlab.py --mode band     # the ribbon: one line, a lateral position each, density
    python pathlab.py --mode flat     # ... and the same band with the pressure term off
    python pathlab.py --map open      # no chokepoint, to see lanes on open ground
    python pathlab.py --headless 6 --scenario cross --map open --units 16 --sweep 20/4/0,20/4/60

Two units are only counted as crossing when they want a cell at the same moment *and* are not
going the same way - traffic following the same road is a queue, and a queue is what a road is
for.  Nor is it charged in a cell with no room to dodge: pricing a two-cell doorway does not
spread anyone out, it sends them to queue at the next doorway instead.

Controls
    left click          order the selection to a point
    right drag          select units (right click empty ground selects all)
    1 / 2 / 3           corridor mode / individual mode / band mode (the ribbon)
    c                   congestion cost on/off
    t                   crossing cost on/off (the time dimension)
    r                   draw the line-of-sight rays planning used
    p                   draw the congestion map
    space               pause
    n                   new map, same mode
    tab                 re-issue the last order (replan with what is on the map now)
    esc                 quit

Red squares are cells two units still plan to be in within PATH_CROSSING_WINDOW frames of each
other - the clashes the crossing cost is there to buy out.
