/**
	* A deliberately minimal fork-join pool.  One entry point, no task dependencies, no work
	* stealing, no futures - because the only workloads on the roadmap are pure functions over an
	* array (THREADING-ROADMAP.md section 3), and everything past fork-join is code nobody has a
	* use for yet.
	*
	* Three rules the callers have to keep, all of them from section 1 of that document:
	*
	*  1. **A job must not allocate.**  Every MemoryPool in the game shares one critical section
	*     (GameMemory.cpp), so one newInstance per work item turns parallel work back into a queue.
	*     Size and allocate on the calling thread before the fork; workers only write into memory
	*     that already exists.  Violations are counted - workerAllocationCount() - rather than left
	*     to be found later as a mystery perf regression.
	*
	*  2. **A job must not touch simulation state.**  The lockstep sequence is the simulation; a
	*     draw from GameLogicRandomValue or a write an Object reads back desyncs a multiplayer game
	*     hours later with no reproducible case.
	*
	*  3. **Output order must not depend on scheduling.**  Write into a pre-sized array indexed by
	*     item, or concatenate per-job lists afterwards in item order.  Never append to one shared
	*     list from inside a job.
	*
	* The FPU control word is per-thread and resets to the CRT default on every new thread, so each
	* worker calls setFPMode() once on entry (section 1.3).

		* machine has processors.
		*

		* interlocked claim for each one".  Anything below 1 is read as 1.
