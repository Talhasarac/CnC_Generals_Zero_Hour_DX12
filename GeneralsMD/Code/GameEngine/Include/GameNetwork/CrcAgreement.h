/* Every so often each machine hashes its world and sends the number to everybody else.  If two of
	 those numbers differ, the simulations have diverged and the match is over - so this decision has
	 to be right, and calling a mismatch that did not happen is as bad as missing one.

	 Two ways to get it wrong, both of them EA's, both of them about players who are on their way out
	 of the game:

	   - A player who leaves stays "connected" for a few more frames than their last CRC message
	     survives.  At a short CRC interval that gap is hit routinely, and a missing CRC is not
	     evidence that anybody computed anything differently - it is evidence that a packet is not
	     here yet.

	   - The reverse: a CRC that arrives from somebody who is *already* gone.  EA compared every
	     entry in the map, so the leaver's last hash - computed on a machine that was in the middle
	     of tearing the game down - was held against everybody who is still playing.

	 So: only hashes from players who are still connected count, and all of them have to be here
	 before anything is compared. */
