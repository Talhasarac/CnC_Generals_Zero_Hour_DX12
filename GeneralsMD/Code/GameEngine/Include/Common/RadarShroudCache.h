/* The radar draws the shroud as a small texture - 128x128 - with black pixels whose alpha says how
	 hidden that part of the map is.  The simulation pokes at it one map cell at a time: every time a
	 unit's line of sight crosses a shroud cell boundary, the cell tells the radar the new state of
	 that one cell, which is one to four pixels.

	 That used to go straight at the texture, and the road it took was expensive beyond belief.  Each
	 call asked the texture for its surface (a Direct3D GetSurfaceLevel plus a wrapper object), then
	 called DrawPixel once per pixel - and DrawPixel is a GetDesc, a LockRect of a one-pixel
	 rectangle, one byte written, and an UnlockRect.  An army on the move crosses hundreds of shroud
	 cells a frame, and the first thing a match does is walk the whole map through
	 refreshShroudForLocalPlayer, one cell at a time.  EA left a note next to the radar's terrain
	 drawing saying they had tried locking once and it made "absolutely *no* performance difference";
	 that was about the terrain, which is drawn once per map, and it is not true of the shroud, which
	 is drawn all match long.

	 So the shroud layer lives here instead, one alpha byte per texture pixel, and the texture is
	 written at most once a frame, over the rectangle that actually changed.  Nothing here touches
	 Direct3D, which is also what makes it testable. */
